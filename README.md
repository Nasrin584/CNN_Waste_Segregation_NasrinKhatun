#### Waste Classification Using CNN
This project presents a deep learning-based solution for automatic waste segregation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model classifies images of waste into seven categories: Cardboard, Food Waste, Glass, Metal, Other, Paper, and Plastic. The workflow includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, handling class imbalance, model development with regularization techniques, and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. The goal is to aid efficient waste management by automating classification, contributing to environmental sustainability and smart city initiatives. This project is particularly useful for those exploring computer vision applications in real-world ecological challenges.
